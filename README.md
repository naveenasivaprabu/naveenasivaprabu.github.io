### Tips to new members

To all new members... please understand that trading is not a place for easy money.

It needs lot of experience and and dedication to read chart and and react quickly when trade goes on opposite sides.
Please invest time with charts and choose a trade plan first.

Your trade plan should contains

	- Entry range
	- Entry price
	- Risk
	- Reward Ratio
	- Risk capacity
	- Exit point
	- Profit point ...and few more things.

If you satisfied with all,then only u should enter into a trade.

Please observe market for few days and learn to control your mind during volatility...

Till u get confidence don't trade,once you get confidence then trade in cash.

One you successful in cash..

Then only you are allowed to trade in **FNO**.

# Our trade rule is always same...no changes so far..

Sometimes you may be confused with entry...at the time remember below important points.


1.For buy trade it is good to take trade when the price break the buy entry from low.

2.For sell trade it is good to take trade when the price is falling from high and breaks below the sell level.


3.Our candles are 5min and 15min only..based on your targeted pts you decide which candle to follow (this rule only applies to whom can't decide what timeframe to use)


4.For jolly trade u should see in chart that price is moving between any two lines...in trend.. jolly trade not allowed


5.Dont try to trade in all moves.... restrict yourself with your own rule for trade..this rule can be ignored once you become good in selecting right trades.


6.when u see 2 red candle closed below your buy line(after you took buy)..then you can consider that more possible to hit your buy SL...so instead of waiting for SL hit..you can book loss at 2 candle close on opposite side.

7.Candle closed ABV then line for buy trade...but 2 nd candle closed near T1...in this condition ignore entry...and wait for T1 line to cross...you can take buy ABV t1(candle close not necessary)

8.Only wick formation can't be considered as breakout for entry/SL...This u will learn only by experience/practice...no other short cuts😊

Hope these points will help you to decide...

If you have still any doubt.. go n watch the video again..(don't ask me 😂)
